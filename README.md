The repository contains the code associated with [Wheeler+ 2020](), less large data files.  The repository is an archive for posterity, rather that a source of code for other people to use.  If you just want to look at the code that implements tangent space projection, that's all in [model.jl](TSP/model.jl)

The table of our derived parameters for each star is available [here]().  

If you have any questions, or would like any of our intermediate data products, please get in touch: `a.wheeler@columbia.edu`.
