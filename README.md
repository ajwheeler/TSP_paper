The repository contains the code associated with [Wheeler+ 2020](), less large data files.  The repository is an archive for posterity--it's not intended to be easily usable by others (but I'm happy to help if you want to try anyway).  If you just want to look at the code that implements tangent space projection, the core algorithm, that's all in [model.jl](TSP/model.jl).

The table of our derived parameters for each star is available [here]().  

If you have any questions, or would like any of our intermediate data products, please get in touch: `a.wheeler@columbia.edu`.
